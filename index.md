Let's do away with that Lorem Ipsum and put something else.

I guess the main thing I am trying to achieve with this Github Pages site, is to have something moderately professional looking and sustainable.

I already have a 'vanity' site at iainsaunders.uk, which I was writing a few blog posts on, but with my data science degree and work, I don't feel like it is something I can put a lot into. Besides that, I just don't have many interesting things to share on a semi-regular basis, I'm a nerdy guy doing nerdy things.

Look at this text as a placeholder for something a bit more data science-y in the future.
